# Bikesharing Data Analysis Project: Excel, SQL & Tableau

<br>

## Overview 

<br>

This case study from the Google Data Analytics Certificate program explores the 2023 data of Cyclistic: a fictional **bikesharing** company. 


For this project, we'll be using **Microsoft Excel, MySQL** and **Tableau**  to do all of our data analysis and answer our hypothetical stakeholder's business questions. All of the datasets I used are stored [here](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html) and they're made available by Motivate International, Inc.  under [this license](https://divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement).

<br>

## Background 
<br>

Our fictional company, **Cyclistic**, is a Chicago-based bikesharing service that currently owns and operates a fleet of over **15,000** bicycles, which are linked to roughly **800** bike stations. Cyclistic users are grouped into two categories: annual members and casual riders. Members pay a yearly subscription in exchange for substantial ride discounts, while casual riders are those who either purchase a day pass, or pay per minute as they ride. 

Since 2016, the company's marketing strategy has been to leverage the company's flexible pricing plans to appeal to as many users as possible, with the goal of maximizing revenue. However, a new report from the finance department shows that annual members are by far the most profitable customer segment. 

<br>

Cyclistic's **Chief Marketing Officer** - Lucy Moreno - has thus decided that it would be most advantageous to **convert existing casual users** into annual members.

However, the marketing team has asked for a little more info on current users to inform their efforts. 

<br>

## Business Questions

<br>

The CMO would like us to answer ****three main questions**** to guide the upcoming marketing program:

<br>

  > 1. How does casual rider behavior differ from annual member behavior?
 
  > 2. Why would casual riders want to buy an annual membership?
 
  > 3. How can Cyclistic leverage digital media to convert casual users into annual members?

# Part I: Downloading and Accessing the Data 

<br>

For this project, I decided to analyze a full year of ridesharing data. After taking a look at the ZIP files, I located the data for 2023 and downloaded it:
